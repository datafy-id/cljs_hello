# Hello CLJS

Yes, its 2025. Long live clojure, long live repl.

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.0. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

## TLDR;

1. Open the project with emacs.

2. `M-x cider-jack-in-cljs` then choose `shadow` then choose `:app` or `:cli` build for target browser and target node-script respectively.

3. You're on roll now.

Open browser http://localhost:8000 (for build target browser) or execute `bun run out/me/main.js` (for build target node) to connect to nrepl server.
